# CSV Parser

The purpose of this application was to re-introduce myself to PHP without the use of frameworks and build a small app using the knowledge of design patterns, OOP, SOLID principles.

## Installation

To install the application, just simply clone it to your desktop or download it.

Make sure you run the following commands -

```bash
npm install
composer install
composer dumpautoload
```

## Finally!!!

You should then be able to see the index.php load up a basic template depending on whether you have passed a file to the **load()** function or not, otherwise you will see a message saying 'File not found'.
